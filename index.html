        <h2>Once upon a time…</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          In Scotland, there was a girl people called a vampire —
          not because she was scary…
          but because she belonged to the night in a quiet, beautiful way.

        <h2>Her secret gift</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          When she missed a feeling… she could slip through time and bring it back.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          Sometimes it looked like a song that hadn’t been written yet.
          And somehow… it always sounded a little like Billie Eilish.

        <h2>The dance</h2>
        <p class="lead">
          One evening, she danced in a brown dress —
          and the world didn’t interrupt her.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          A deer watched from the trees. Birds turned in slow circles.
          Even the wind softened, like it was trying not to break the moment.

        <p class="lead">
          He didn’t rush in. He didn’t want to ruin the magic.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          He just stood there, watching —
          like he’d accidentally found something rare.

        <p class="lead">
          He stepped closer, gentle as a whisper.
          <span class="quote">“Selam,”</span> he said.
          <span class="quote">“You look so free when you dance.”</span>
        </p>

          She tilted her head, amused:
          <span class="quote">“Çok mu çok?”</span>
          <br/>
          He smiled:
          <span class="quote">“Çok… çok.”</span>

        <p class="dim">
          The man reached into nowhere —
          first: a banana 🍌
          then: dark chocolate 🍫
          then: a latte ☕
        </p>
        <p class="tiny">She took them like it was the most normal magic in the world… and smiled.</p>

        <p class="lead">
          They walked through Scotland like the streets were holding their secret.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          Talking. Teasing. Pausing.
          The kind of closeness that doesn’t ask permission —
          it just happens… and suddenly you don’t want it to end.

        <p class="lead">
          A wind turned the page.
          Scotland faded into silence —
          and the desert appeared: Türkmenistan at night.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          As if the story approved… their clothes changed —
          Türkmen tradition, warm and beautiful —
          not a costume… more like destiny.

        <p class="lead">
          Under a sky full of stars, the man whispered:

        <p class="dim">
          She smiled:

        </p>
        <p class="lead emph">And then — a light rain started.</p>
        <p class="dim">A hug. A pause. And a kiss.</p>
