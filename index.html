        <p class="lead">
          There was a girl in a castle-quiet place, with Scotland air and wild green hills.
          Some nights she didn’t time-travel for places…
          she time-traveled for the exact <span class="emph">emotion</span>.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">And when she found it, she’d press play on a song that wasn’t invented yet.</p>

          People called her a vampire… not because she was scary,
          but because she had this calm night-magic in her eyes.

          The forest didn’t interrupt. Even the animals kept it subtle,

          Like the world suddenly had a new center.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          He didn’t stop the dance. He didn’t steal the moment.
          He just stood there thinking: <span class="quote">“wow.”</span>

          She finally noticed him… and smiled the kind of smile that makes time behave.

        <p class="dim">
          He tried to speak, but she beat him to it — playful as always:
          <span class="quote">“Çok mu çok?”</span>

        <p class="dim">

          Dancing makes her hungry — fast.
          So he pulled out the most serious toolkit:
          bananas… dark chocolate… and a latte like a warm spell.
        </p>
        <p class="dim">
          She didn’t say thank you right away. She just smiled.
          The kind that says: <span class="quote">“you know me.”</span>
